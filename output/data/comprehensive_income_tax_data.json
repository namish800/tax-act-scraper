Thus, while computing surcharge, in case of taxpayers (i.e. Individuals/HUF/AOP/BOI/artificial juridical person) having total income of more than Rs. 50 lakh marginal relief shall be available in such a manner that the net amount payable as income-tax and surcharge shall not exceed the total amount payable as income-tax on total income of Rs. 50 lakh by more than the amount of income that exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. In case of a company, surcharge is levied @ 7% (2% in case of foreign company) on the amount of income-tax if the total income exceeds Rs. 1 crore but does not exceed Rs. 10 crore and @ 12% (5% in case of foreign company) on the amount of income-tax if total income exceeds Rs. 10 crore. Hence, in case of company whose total income exceeds Rs. 1 crore but does not exceeds Rs. 10 crore, marginal relief will be computed as discussed above, but in the case of company having total income above Rs. 10 crore marginal relief is available in such a manner that the net amount payable as income-tax and surcharge shall not exceed the total amount payable as income-tax and surcharge on total income of Rs. 10 crore by more than the amount of income that exceeds Rs. 10 crore.

The CBDT has issued the final guidelines for determination of POEM of a foreign company.The final guidelines on POEM contain some unique features. One of the unique features is test of Active Business Outside India (ABOI). The guidelines prescribe that a company shall be said to engaged in 'active business outside India' if passive income is not more than 50% of its total income. Further, there are certain additional cumulative conditions to be satisfied regarding location of total assets, employees and payroll expenses.The place of effective management in case of a company engaged in active business outside India shall be presumed to be outside India if the majority meetings of the board of directors of the company are held outside India.In cases of companies other than those that are engaged in active business outside India, the determination of POEM would be a two stage process, namely:First stage would be identification or ascertaining the person or persons who actually make the key management and commercial decision for conduct of the company's business as a whole.Second stage would be determination of place where these decisions are in fact being made.However, it has been provided that the POEM guidelines shall not apply to a company having turnover or gross receipts of INR 50 crores or less in a financial year vide CIRCULAR NO.8, DATED 23-2-2017.(To know more about POEM guidelines, read CIRCULAR NO.6, DATED 24-1-2017.)"

If the HUF turns to be a resident, then the next step is to ascertain whether it is resident and ordinarily resident or is resident but not ordinarily resident. Step 1 given below will ascertain whether the HUF is resident or non-resident and step 2 will ascertain whether the HUF is ordinarily resident or not ordinarily resident. Step 2 is to be performed only if the HUF turns to be a resident. Step 1: Determining whether resident or non-resident For the purpose of Income-tax Law, a HUF will be treated as resident in India, if the control and management of the affairs of the HUF is located (partly or wholly) in India. Step 2: Determining whether resident and ordinarily resident or resident but not ordinarily residentA resident HUF will be treated as resident and ordinarily resident in India during the year if its manager (i.e. karta or manager) satisfies both the following conditions :(1) He is resident in India for at least 2 years out of 10 years immediately preceding the relevant year.(2) His stay in India is for 730 days or more during 7 years immediately preceding the relevant year. A resident HUF whose manager (i.e. karta or manager) does not satisfy any of the aforesaid conditions or satisfies only one of the aforesaid conditions will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident.In short, following test will determine the residential status of a HUF :If the control and management of the affairs of the HUF is located (partly or wholly) in India and the manager (i.e. karta or manager) satisfies both the conditions specified at step 2, then the HUF will become resident and ordinarily resident in India. If the control and management of the affairs of the HUF is located (partly or wholly) in India and the manager (i.e. karta or manager) satisfies none or only one condition specified at step 2, then the HUF will become resident but not ordinarily resident in India.

Step 2 is to be performed only if the individual turns to be a resident. Step 1: Determining whether resident or non-resident Under the Income-tax Law, an individual will be treated as a resident in India for a year if he satisfies any of the following conditions (i.e. may satisfy any one or may satisfy both the conditions):(1) He is in India for a period of 182 days or more in that year; or(2) He is in India for a period of 60 days or more in the year and for a period of 365 days or more in 4 years immediately preceding the relevant year. However, in respect of an Indian citizen and a person of Indian origin who visits India during the year, the period of 60 days as mentioned in (2) above shall be substituted with 182 days. The similar concession is provided to the Indian citizen who leaves India in any previous year as a crew member or for the purpose of employment outside India.The Finance Act, 2020, w.e.f., Assessment Year 2021-22 has amended the above exception to provide that the period of 60 days as mentioned in (2) above shall be substituted with 120 days, if an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin whose total income, other than income from foreign sources, exceeds Rs. 15 lakhs during the previous year. Income from foreign sources means income which accrues or arises outside India (except income derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India).Note: The Finance Act, 2020 has introduced new section 6(1A) to the Income-tax Act, 1961. The new provision provides that an Indian citizen shall be deemed to be resident in India only if his total income, other than income from foreign sources, exceeds Rs. 15 lakhs during the previous year. For this provision, income from foreign sources means income which accrues or arises outside India (except income derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India).However, such individual shall be deemed to be Indian resident only when he is not liable to tax in any country or jurisdiction by reason of his domicile or residence or any other criteria of similar nature. Thus, from Assessment Year 2021-22, an Indian Citizen earning total income in excess of Rs. 15 lakhs (other than from foreign sources) shall be deemed to be resident in India if he is not liable to pay tax in any country. Step 2: Determining whether resident and ordinarily resident or resident but not ordinarily residentA resident individual will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident in India during the year if he satisfies following conditions:(1) He is non-resident in India in 9 out of last 10 years immediately preceding the relevant year; or(2) His stay in India is for 729 days or less during 7 years immediately preceding the relevant year.However, w.e.f., Assessment Year 2021-22, the Finance Act, 2020 has inserted the following two more situations wherein a resident person is deemed to be Not Ordinarily Resident in India:a) An Indian Citizen or a person of Indian origin whose total income (other than income from foreign sources) exceeds Rs. 15 lakhs during the previous year and who has been in India for a period of 120 days or more but less than 182 days;b) An Indian Citizen who is deemed to be resident in India as per new section 6(1A).A resident individual who does not satisfy any of the aforesaid conditions or satisfies only one of the aforesaid conditions will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident.In short, following test will determine the residential status of an individual:If the individual satisfy any one or both the conditions specified at step 1 and satisfies any of the conditions specified at step 2, then he will become resident and ordinarily resident in India. If the individual satisfy any one or both the conditions specified at step 1 and satisfies any of the condition specified at step 2, then he will become resident but not ordinarily resident in India. If the individual satisfy no conditions satisfied at step one, then he will become non-resident. Click here to calculate Residential Status"

Income from foreign sources means income which accrues or arises outside India (except income derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India).Note: The Finance Act, 2020 has introduced new to the Income-tax Act, 1961. The new provision provides that an Indian citizen shall be deemed to be resident in India only if his total income, other than income from foreign sources, exceeds Rs. 15 lakhs during the previous year. For this provision, income from foreign sources means income which accrues or arises outside India (except income derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India).However, such individual shall be deemed to be Indian resident only when he is not liable to tax in any country or jurisdiction by reason of his domicile or residence or any other criteria of similar nature. Thus, from Assessment Year 2021-22, an Indian Citizen earning total income in excess of Rs. 15 lakhs (other than from foreign sources) shall be deemed to be resident in India if he is not liable to pay tax in any country. Step 2: Determining whether resident and ordinarily resident or resident but not ordinarily residentA resident individual will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident in India during the year if he satisfies following conditions:(1) He is non-resident in India in 9 out of last 10 years immediately preceding the relevant year; or(2) His stay in India is for 729 days or less during 7 years immediately preceding the relevant year.However, w.e.f., Assessment Year 2021-22, the Finance Act, 2020 has inserted the following two more situations wherein a resident person is deemed to be Not Ordinarily Resident in India:a) An Indian Citizen or a person of Indian origin whose total income (other than income from foreign sources) exceeds Rs. 15 lakhs during the previous year and who has been in India for a period of 120 days or more but less than 182 days;b) An Indian Citizen who is deemed to be resident in India as per new .A resident individual who does not satisfy any of the aforesaid conditions or satisfies only one of the aforesaid conditions will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident.In short, following test will determine the residential status of an individual:If the individual satisfy any one or both the conditions specified at step 1 and satisfies any of the conditions specified at step 2, then he will become resident and ordinarily resident in India. If the individual satisfy any one or both the conditions specified at step 1 and satisfies any of the condition specified at step 2, then he will become resident but not ordinarily resident in India. If the individual satisfy no conditions satisfied at step one, then he will become non-resident. Click here to calculate Residential Status"
