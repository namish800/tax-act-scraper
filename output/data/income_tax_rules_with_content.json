and sub-item (_iv_), \"normal allowance\" means the amount of depreciation allowance [other than the extra depreciation allowance under this sub-item or the extra shift depreciation allowance under sub-item (_iv_)] which is allowable under rule 5.****| | | | | |   \n| (_iv_) _Extra shift depreciation allowance:_| | | | | |   \n|  An extra allowance up to a maximum of an amount equal to one-half of the normal allowance shall be allowed where a concern claims such allowance on account of double shift working and establishes that it has worked double shift.
