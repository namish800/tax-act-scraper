(the officer so authorised in all cases being hereinafter referred to as the authorised officer) to—

(_i_)|  |  enter and search any building, place, vessel, vehicle or aircraft where he has reason to suspect that such books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing are kept;  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah or other receptacle for exercising the powers conferred by clause (_i_) where the keys thereof are not available;

**Provided further** that where it is not possible or practicable to take physical possession of any valuable article or thing and remove it to a safe place due to its volume, weight or other physical characteristics or due to its being of a dangerous nature, the authorised officer may serve an order on the owner or the person who is in immediate possession or control thereof that he shall not remove, part with or otherwise deal with it, except with the previous permission of such authorised officer and such action of the authorised officer shall be deemed to be seizure of such valuable article or thing under clause (_iii_):
