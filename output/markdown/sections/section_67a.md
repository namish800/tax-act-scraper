(_c_) |  |  where the amount apportioned to a member under clause (_a_) is a loss, any interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration aforesaid paid to the member by the association or body in respect of the previous year shall be adjusted against that amount, and the result shall be treated as the member's share in the income of the association or body.
