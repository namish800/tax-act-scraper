(_a_) |  |  if the cost of the new asset is not less than the net consideration in respect of the original asset, the whole of such capital gain shall not be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) ;  
---|---|---  
(_b_) |  |  if the cost of the new asset is less than the net consideration in respect of the original asset, so much of the capital gain as bears to the whole of the capital gain the same proportion as the cost of the new asset bears to the net consideration, shall not be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);):  
  
**Provided** that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply where—

(3) Where the new asset is transferred within a period of three years from the date of its purchase or, as the case may be, its construction, the amount of capital gain arising from the transfer of the original asset not charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) on the basis of the cost of such new asset as provided in clause (_a_) or, as the case may be, clause (_b_), of sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be income chargeable under the head "Capital gains" relating to long-term capital assets of the previous year in which such new asset is transferred.

(4) The amount of the net consideration which is not appropriated by the assessee towards the purchase of the new asset made within one year before the date on which the transfer of the original asset took place, or which is not utilised by him for the purchase or construction of the new asset before the date of furnishing the return of income under [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);), shall be deposited by him before furnishing such return [such deposit being made in any case not later than the due date applicable in the case of the assessee for furnishing the return of income under sub-section (1) of [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);)] in an account in any such bank or institution as may be specified in, and utilised in accordance with, any scheme which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, frame in this behalf and such return shall be accompanied by proof of such deposit ; and, for the purposes of sub-section (1), the amount, if any, already utilised by the assessee for the purchase or construction of the new asset together with the amount so deposited shall [60](javascript:ShowFootnote\('fn60'\);)[, subject to the second proviso to sub-section (1)] be deemed to be the cost of the new asset :
