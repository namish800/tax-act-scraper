(_d_)|  |  the sum payable by, or the amount of refund due to, the collector, shall be determined after adjustment of the amount computed under clause (_b_) and clause (_c_) against any amount paid under [section 206C](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091330', ''\);) or [section 234E](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091370', ''\);) and any amount paid otherwise by way of tax or interest or fee;  
(_e_)|  |  an intimation shall be prepared or generated and sent to the collector specifying the sum determined to be payable by, or the amount of refund due to, him under clause (_d_); and  
(_f_)|  |  the amount of refund due to the collector in pursuance of the determination under clause (_d_) shall be granted to the collector:  
  
**Provided** that no intimation under this sub-section shall be sent after the expiry of the period of one year from the end of the financial year in which the statement is filed.

_Explanation._ —For the purposes of this sub-section, "an incorrect claim apparent from any information in the statement" shall mean a claim, on the basis of an entry, in the statement—

(_i_)|  |  of an item, which is inconsistent with another entry of the same or some other item in such statement;  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  in respect of rate of collection of tax at source, where such rate is not in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
