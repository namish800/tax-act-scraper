**Providedfurther** that in any case where a reference is or has to be made under sub-section (2) of [section 269J](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091465', ''\);) to the court for the determination of the amount by which the compensation payable under sub-section (1) of that section shall be reduced or increased, the amount of such compensation as reduced or increased by the amount estimated in that behalf by the competent authority for the purposes of such reference shall be tendered as aforesaid.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), if any dispute arises as to the apportionment of the compensation amongst persons claiming to be entitled thereto, the Central Government shall deposit in the court the compensation required to be tendered under sub-section (1) and refer such dispute for the decision of the court and the decision of the court thereon shall be final.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), if the persons entitled to compensation do not consent to receive it, or if there is no person competent to alienate the immovable property, or if there is any dispute as to the title to receive the compensation, the Central Government shall deposit in the court the compensation required to be tendered under sub-section (1) and refer the matter for the decision of the court :

**Provided** that nothing herein contained shall affect the liability of any person who may receive the whole or any part of the compensation for any immovable property acquired under this Chapter to pay the same to the person lawfully entitled thereto.

(4) If the Central Government fails to tender under sub-section (1) or deposit under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) the whole or any part of the compensation required to be tendered or deposited thereunder within thirty days of the date on which the immovable property to which the compensation relates becomes vested in the Central Government under sub-section (4) of [section 269-I](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091464', ''\);), the Central Government shall be liable to pay simple interest at the rate of fifteen per cent per annum reckoned from the day immediately following the date of expiry of the said period up to the date on which it so tenders or deposits such compensation or, as the case may be, such part of the compensation.

(5) Where any amount of compensation (including interest, if any, thereon) has been deposited in the court under this section, the court may, either of its own motion or on an application made by or on behalf of any party interested or claiming to be interested in such amount, order the same to be invested in such Government or other securities as it may think proper, and may direct the interest or other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated and paid in such manner as will, in its opinion, give the parties interested therein the same benefit therefrom as they might have had from the immovable property in respect whereof such amount has been deposited or as near thereto as may be.
