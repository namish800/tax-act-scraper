---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  the cost of acquisition of the asset and the cost of any improvement thereto:

|  |  _Explanation 1.—_ For the removal of doubt, it is hereby clarified that the cost of acquisition of a unit of a business trust shall be reduced and shall be deemed to have always been reduced by any sum received by a unit holder from the business trust with respect to such unit, which is not in the nature of income as referred to in clause (_23FC_) or clause (_23FCA_) of [section 10](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090722', ''\);) and which is not chargeable to tax under clause (_xii_) of sub-section (2) of [section 56](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090855', ''\);) and under sub-section (2) of [section 115UA](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091086', ''\);).  
|  |  _Explanation 2.—_ For the purposes of _Explanation 1,_ it is clarified that where transaction of transfer of a unit is not considered as transfer under [section 47](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090823', ''\);) and cost of acquisition of such unit is determined under [section 49](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090826', ''\);), sum received with respect to such unit before such transaction as well as after such transaction shall be reduced from the cost of acquisition under the said _Explanation;_]  
(_iii_)|  |  in case of value of any money or capital asset received by a specified person from a specified entity referred to in sub­section (4) of [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);), the amount chargeable to income-tax as income of such specified entity under that sub-section which is attributable to the capital asset being transferred by the specified entity, calculated in the prescribed manner:  
  
**Provided** that in the case of an assessee, who is a non-resident, capital gains arising from the transfer of a capital asset being shares in, or debentures of, an Indian company shall be computed by converting the cost of acquisition, expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer and the full value of the consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset into the same foreign currency as was initially utilised in the purchase of the shares or debentures, and the capital gains so computed in such foreign currency shall be reconverted into Indian currency, so, however, that the aforesaid manner of computation of capital gains shall be applicable in respect of capital gains accruing or arising from every reinvestment thereafter in, and sale of, shares in, or debentures of, an Indian company :

**Provided further** that where long-term capital gain arises from the transfer [48b](javascript:ShowFootnote\('fn48b'\);)[(which takes place before the 23rd day of July, 2024)] of a long-term capital asset, other than capital gain arising to a non-resident from the transfer of shares in, or debentures of, an Indian company referred to in the first proviso, the provisions of clause (_ii_) shall have effect as if for the words "cost of acquisition" and "cost of any improvement", the words "indexed cost of acquisition" and "indexed cost of any improvement" had respectively been substituted:

**Provided also** that nothing contained in the first and second provisos shall apply to the capital gains arising from the transfer of a long-term capital asset being an equity share in a company or a unit of an equity oriented fund or a unit of a business trust referred to in [section 112A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091019', ''\);):

**Provided also** that nothing contained in the second proviso shall apply to the long-term capital gain arising from the transfer of a long-term capital asset, being a bond or debenture other than—

(_a_)|  |  capital indexed bonds issued by the Government; or  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  Sovereign Gold Bond issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme, 2015:  
  
**Provided also** that in case of an assessee being a non-resident, any gains arising on account of appreciation of rupee against a foreign currency at the time of redemption of rupee denominated bond of an Indian company held by him, shall be ignored for the purposes of computation of full value of consideration under this section:

**Provided also** that where shares, debentures or warrants referred to in the proviso to clause (_iii_) of [section 47](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090823', ''\);) are transferred under a gift or an irrevocable trust, the market value on the date of such transfer shall be deemed to be the full value of consideration received or accruing as a result of transfer for the purposes of this section :

**Provided also** that no deduction shall be allowed in computing the income chargeable under the head "Capital gains" in respect of any sum paid on account of securities transaction tax under Chapter VII of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004.
