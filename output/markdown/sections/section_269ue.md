**Vesting of property in Central Government.**

**269UE.**(1) Where an order under sub-section (1) of [section 269UD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091485', ''\);) is made by the appropriate authority in respect of an immovable property referred to in sub-clause (_i_) of clause (_d_) of [section 269UA](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091482', ''\);), such property shall, on the date of such order, vest in the Central Government in terms of the agreement for transfer referred to in sub-section (1) of [section 269UC](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091484', ''\);) :

**Provided** that where the appropriate authority, after giving an opportunity of being heard to the transferor, the transferee or other persons interested in the said property, under sub-section (1A) of [section 269UD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091485', ''\);), is of the opinion that any encumbrance on the property or leasehold interest specified in the aforesaid agreement for transfer is so specified with a view to defeat the provisions of this Chapter, it may, by order, declare such encumbrance or leasehold interest to be void and thereupon the aforesaid property shall vest in the Central Government free from such encumbrance or leasehold interest.

(2) The transferor or any other person who may be in possession of the immovable property in respect of which an order under sub-section (1) of [section 269UD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091485', ''\);) is made, shall surrender or deliver possession thereof to the appropriate authority or any other person duly authorised by the appropriate authority in this behalf within fifteen days of the service of such order on him :

**Provided** that the provisions of this sub-section and sub-sections (3) and (4) shall not apply where the person in possession of the immovable property, in respect of which an order under sub-section (1) of [section 269UD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091485', ''\);) is made, is a _bona fide_ holder of any encumbrance on such property or a _bona fide_ lessee of such property, if the said encumbrance or lease has not been declared void under the proviso to sub-section (1) and such person is eligible to continue in possession of such property even after the transfer in terms of the aforesaid agreement for transfer.

(3) If any person refuses or fails to comply with the provisions of sub-section (2), the appropriate authority or other person duly authorised by it under that sub-section may take possession of the immovable property and may, for that purpose, use such force as may be necessary.

(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the appropriate authority may, for the purpose of taking possession of any property referred to in sub-section (1), requisition the services of any police officer to assist him and it shall be the duty of such officer to comply with such requisition.

(5) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that nothing in this section shall operate to discharge the transferor or any other person (not being the Central Government) from liability in respect of any encumbrances on the property and, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, such liability may be enforced against the transferor or such other person.

(6) Where an order under sub-section (1) of [section 269UD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091485', ''\);) is made in respect of an immovable property, being rights of the nature referred to in sub-clause (_ii_) of clause (_d_) of [section 269UA](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091482', ''\);), such order shall have the effect ofâ€”

(_a_)|  |  vesting such right in the Central Government ; and  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  placing the Central Government in the same position in relation to such rights as the person in whom such a right would have continued to vest if such order had not been made.  
  
(7) Where any rights in respect of any immovable property, being rights in, or with respect to, any land or any building or part of a building which has been constructed or which is to be constructed, have been vested in the Central Government under sub-section (6), the provisions of sub-sections (1), (2), (3) and (4) shall, so far as may be, have effect as if the references to immovable property therein were references to such land or building or part thereof, as the case may be.
