**Provided** that the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or, as the case may be, Principal Director General or Director General may issue such instructions or directions to the aforesaid income-tax authorities as he may deem fit for institution of proceedings under this sub-section.

_Explanation._ —For the purposes of this section, "appropriate authority" shall have the same meaning as in clause (_c_) of [section 269UA](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091482', ''\);).

(1A) A person shall not be proceeded against for an offence under [section 276C](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091551', ''\);) or [section 277](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091557', ''\);) in relation to the assessment for an assessment year in respect of which the penalty imposed or imposable on him under [section 270A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091499', ''\);) or clause (_iii_) of sub-section (1) of [section 271](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091501', ''\);) has been reduced or waived by an order under [section 273A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091538', ''\);).

(2) Any offence under this Chapter may, either before or after the institution of proceedings, be compounded by the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or a Principal Director General or Director General.

(3) Where any proceeding has been taken against any person under sub-section (1), any statement made or account or other document produced by such person before any of the income-tax authorities specified in clauses (_a_) to (_g_) of [section 116](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091134', ''\);) shall not be inadmissible as evidence for the purpose of such proceedings merely on the ground that such statement was made or such account or other document was produced in the belief that the penalty imposable would be reduced or waived, under [section 273A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091538', ''\);) or that the offence in respect of which such proceeding was taken would be compounded.

(4) The Central Government may make a scheme, by notification in the Official Gazette, for the purposes of granting sanction under sub-section (1) or compounding under sub-section (2), so as to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability by—

(_a_)|  |  eliminating the interface between the income-tax authority and the assessee or any other person to the extent technologically feasible;  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  optimising utilisation of the resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation;  
(_c_)|  |  introducing a team-based sanction to proceed against, or for compounding of, an offence, with dynamic jurisdiction.  
  
(5) The Central Government may, for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under sub-section (4), by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall apply with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the notification:

**Provided** that no direction shall be issued after the 31st day of March, 2022.

(6) Every notification issued under sub-section (4) and sub-section (5) shall, as soon as may be after the notification is issued, be laid before each House of Parliament.

_Explanation._ —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the power of the Board to issue orders, instructions or directions under this Act shall include and shall be deemed always to have included the power to issue instructions or directions (including instructions or directions to obtain the previous approval of the Board) to other income-tax authorities for the proper composition of offences under this section.
