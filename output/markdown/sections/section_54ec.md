(_a_) |  |  if the cost of the long-term specified asset is not less than the capital gain arising from the transfer of the original asset, the whole of such capital gain shall not be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\););  
---|---|---  
(_b_) |  |  if the cost of the long-term specified asset is less than the capital gain arising from the transfer of the original asset, so much of the capital gain as bears to the whole of the capital gain the same proportion as the cost of acquisition of the long-term specified asset bears to the whole of the capital gain, shall not be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) :  
  
**Provided** that the investment made on or after the 1st day of April, 2007 in the long-term specified asset by an assessee during any financial year does not exceed fifty lakh rupees :

**Provided further** that the investment made by an assessee in the long-term specified asset, from capital gains arising from transfer of one or more original assets, during the financial year in which the original asset or assets are transferred and in the subsequent financial year does not exceed fifty lakh rupees.

(2) Where the long-term specified asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than by transfer) into money at any time within a period of three years from the date of its acquisition, the amount of capital gains arising from the transfer of the original asset not charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) on the basis of the cost of such long-term specified asset as provided in clause (_a_) or, as the case may be, clause (_b_) of sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be the income chargeable under the head "Capital gains" relating to long-term capital asset of the previous year in which the long-term specified asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than by transfer) into money:

**Provided** that in case of long-term specified asset referred to in sub-clause (_ii_) of clause (_ba_) of the _Explanation_ occurring after sub-section (3), this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words "three years", the words "five years" had been substituted.

_Explanation.—_ In a case where the original asset is transferred and the assessee invests the whole or any part of the capital gain received or accrued as a result of transfer of the original asset in any long-term specified asset and such assessee takes any loan or advance on the security of such specified asset, he shall be deemed to have converted (otherwise than by transfer) such specified asset into money on the date on which such loan or advance is taken.

(3) Where the cost of the long-term specified asset has been taken into account for the purposes of clause (_a_) or clause (_b_) of sub-section (1),—

(_a_) |  | [57](javascript:ShowFootnote\('fn57'\);)[***]
