**Provided** that if the amount deposited under this sub-section is not utilised wholly or partly for the purchase or construction of the new asset within the period specified in sub-section (1), then,—

(_i_)|  |  the amount not so utilised shall be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) as the income of the previous year in which the period of three years from the date of the transfer of the original asset expires; and
