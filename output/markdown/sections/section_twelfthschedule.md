(_ix_)|  |  Agglomerated iron ore.  
(_x_)|  |  Cut and polished minerals and rocks including cut and polished granite.  
  
_Explanation_.—For the purposes of this Schedule, "processed", in relation to any mineral or ore, means—

(_a_)|  |  dressing through mechanical means to obtain concentrates after removal of gangue and unwanted deleterious substances or through other means without altering the mineralogical identity;  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  pulverisation, calcination or micronisation;  
(_c_)|  |  agglomeration from fines;  
(_d_)|  |  cutting and polishing;  
(_e_)|  |  washing and levigation;  
(_f_)|  |  beneficiation by mechanical crushing and screening through dry process;  
(_g_)|  |  sizing by crushing, screening, washing and classification through wet process;  
(_h_)|  |  other upgrading techniques such as removal of impurities through chemical treatment, refining by gravity separation, bleaching, floata-tion or filtration.
