(_B_)|  |  such person offers an explanation which he is not able to substantiate and fails to prove that such explanation is _bona fide_ and that all the facts relating to the same and material to the computation of his total income have been disclosed by him,  
  
then, the amount added or disallowed in computing the total income of such person as a result thereof shall, for the purposes of clause (_c_) of this sub-section, be deemed to represent the income in respect of which particulars have been concealed.

_Explanation 2._ —Where the source of any receipt, deposit, outgoing or investment in any assessment year is claimed by any person to be an amount which had been added in computing the income or deducted in computing the loss in the assessment of such person for any earlier assessment year or years but in respect of which no penalty under clause (_iii_) of this sub-section had been levied, that part of the amount so added or deducted in such earlier assessment year immediately preceding the year in which the receipt, deposit, outgoing or investment appears (such earlier assessment year hereafter in this _Explanation_ referred to as the first preceding year) which is sufficient to cover the amount represented by such receipt, deposit or outgoing or value of such investment (such amount or value hereafter in this _Explanation_ referred to as the utilised amount) shall be treated as the income of the assessee, particulars of which had been concealed or inaccurate particulars of which had been furnished for the first preceding year; and where the amount so added or deducted in the first preceding year is not sufficient to cover the utilised amount, that part of the amount so added or deducted in the year immediately preceding the first preceding year which is sufficient to cover such part of the utilised amount as is not so covered shall be treated to be the income of the assessee, particulars of which had been concealed or inaccurate particulars of which had been furnished for the year immediately preceding the first preceding year and so on, until the entire utilised amount is covered by the amounts so added or deducted in such earlier assessment years.

(_a_)|  |  the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be determined in accordance with the following formula—

|  |  _B_ = amount of tax that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the general provisions been reduced by the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished;  
|  |  _C_ = amount of tax on the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in [section 115JB](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091057', ''\);) or [section 115JC](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091058', ''\););  
|  |  _D_ = amount of tax that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in [section 115JB](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091057', ''\);) or [section 115JC](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091058', ''\);) been reduced by the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished:  
|  | **Provided** that where the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished on any issue is considered both under the provisions contained in [section 115JB](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091057', ''\);) or [section 115JC](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091058', ''\);) and under general provisions, such amount shall not be reduced from total income assessed while determining the amount under item _D_ :  
|  | **Provided further** that in a case where the provisions contained in [section 115JB](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091057', ''\);) or [section 115JC](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091058', ''\);) are not applicable, the item (_C - D_) in the formula shall be ignored;  
(_b_)|  |  where in any case the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished has the effect of reducing the loss declared in the return or converting that loss into income, the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be determined in accordance with the formula specified in clause (_a_) with the modification that the amount to be determined for item (_A_ \- _B_)in that formula shall be the amount of tax that would have been chargeable on the income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished had such income been the total income;  
(_c_)|  |  where in any case to which _Explanation 3_ applies, the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be the tax on the total income assessed as reduced by the amount of advance tax, tax deducted at source, tax collected at source and self-assessment tax paid before the issue of notice under [section 148](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091192', ''\);).

---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  for any previous year which is to end on or after the date of the search,  
  
then, notwithstanding that such income is declared by him in any return of income furnished on or after the date of the search, he shall, for the purposes of imposition of a penalty under clause (_c_) of sub-section (1) of this section, be deemed to have concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of such income, unless,—

(_1_)|  |  such income is, or the transactions resulting in such income are recorded,—

(_i_)|  |  in a case falling under clause (_a_), before the date of the search; and  
---|---|---

(_i_)|  |  any money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing (hereafter in this _Explanation_ referred to as assets) and the assessee claims that such assets have been acquired by him by utilising (wholly or in part) his income for any previous year; or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  any income based on any entry in any books of account or other documents or transactions and he claims that such entry in the books of account or other documents or transactions represents his income (wholly or in part) for any previous year,
