_Explanation._ —Where in the case of a small-scale industrial undertaking, any machinery or plant or any part thereof previously used for any purpose is transferred to a new business and the total value of the machinery or plant or part so transferred does not exceed twenty per cent of the total value of the machinery or plant used in the business, then, for the purposes of clause (_iii_) of this sub-section, the condition specified therein shall be deemed to have been fulfilled.

(4) Where the assessee is a person, other than a company or a co-operative society, the deduction under sub-section (1) shall not be admissible unless the accounts of the small-scale industrial undertaking for the previous year relevant to the assessment year for which the deduction is claimed have been audited by an accountant as defined in the _Explanation_ below sub-section (2) of [section 288](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091599', ''\);) and the assessee furnishes, along with his return of income, the report of such audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant.
