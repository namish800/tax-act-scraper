(3) The Assessing Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, may, by order in writing,—

---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  reject the claim if he or it is not so satisfied.  
  
(4) Where a claim is admitted under sub-section (3),—

(5) When the decision on the question of law in the other case becomes final, it shall be applied to the relevant case and the Assessing Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, shall, if necessary, amend the order referred to in clause (_a_) of sub-section (4) conformably to such decision.

(6) An order under sub-section (3) shall be final and shall not be called in question in any proceeding by way of appeal, reference or revision under this Act.
