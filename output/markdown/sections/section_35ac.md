**Provided** that a company may, for claiming the deduction under this sub-section, incur expenditure either by way of payment of any sum as aforesaid or directly on the eligible project or scheme.

(2) The deduction under sub-section (1) shall not be allowed unless the assessee furnishes along with his return of income a certificate—

_Explanation._ —The deduction, to which the assessee is entitled in respect of any sum paid to a public sector company or a local authority or to an association or institution for carrying out the eligible project or scheme referred to in this section applies, shall not be denied merely on the ground that subsequent to the payment of such sum by the assessee,—

(_i_) |  |  that the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) is satisfied that the project or the scheme is not being carried on in accordance with all or any of the conditions subject to which approval was granted; or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_) |  |  such association or institution, to which approval has been granted, has not furnished to the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption), after the end of each financial year, a report in such form and setting forth such particulars and within such time as may be prescribed,  
  
the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) may, at any time, after giving a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed withdrawal to the concerned association or institution, withdraw the approval:

(_i_) |  |  the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) is satisfied that the project or the scheme is not being carried on in accordance with all or any of the conditions subject to which such project or scheme was notified; or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_) |  |  a report in respect of such eligible project or scheme has not been furnished after the end of each financial year, in such form and setting forth such particulars and within such time as may be prescribed,  
  
such notification may be withdrawn in the same manner in which it was issued:

**Provided** that a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed withdrawal shall be given by the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) to the concerned association, institution, public sector company or local authority, as the case may be:

**Provided further** that a copy of the notification by which the notification of the eligible project or scheme is withdrawn shall be forwarded to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over the concerned association, institution, public sector company or local authority, as the case may be, carrying on such eligible project or scheme.

(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, where—

(_i_) |  |  the approval of the National Committee, granted to an association or institution, is withdrawn under sub-section (4) or the notification in respect of eligible project or scheme is withdrawn in the case of a public sector company or local authority or an association or institution under sub-section (5); or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_) |  |  a company has claimed deduction under the proviso to sub-section (1) in respect of any expenditure incurred directly on the eligible project or scheme and the approval for such project or scheme is withdrawn by the National Committee or the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption) or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (Exemption), as the case may be under sub-section (5),  
  
the total amount of the payment received by the public sector company or the local authority or the association or the institution, as the case may be, in respect of which such company or authority or association or institution has furnished a certificate referred to in clause (_a_) of sub-section (2) or the deduction claimed by a company under the proviso to sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be the income of such company or authority or association or institution, as the case may be, for the previous year in which such approval or notification is withdrawn and tax shall be charged on such income at the maximum marginal rate in force for that year.

(7) No deduction under this section shall be allowed in respect of any assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 2018.
