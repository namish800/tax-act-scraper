**Provided** that in the case of an assessee, being a co-operative society, the provisions of this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words "seven assessment years", the words "nine assessment years" had been substituted :

**Provided further** that in the case of an assessee carrying on the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft, the provisions of this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words "seven assessment years", the words "four assessment years" had been substituted:

**Provided also** that in the case of—

(_i_) |  |  an industrial undertaking which begins to manufacture or produce articles or things or to operate its cold storage plant or plants; or

(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, the profits and gains of an industrial undertaking or a ship or the business of a hotel or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft to which the provisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, for the purposes of determining the quantum of deduction under sub-section (1) for the assessment year immediately succeeding the initial assessment year or any subsequent assessment year, be computed as if such industrial undertaking or ship or the business of the hotel or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft were the only source of income of the assessee during the previous years relevant to the initial assessment year and to every subsequent assessment year up to and including the assessment year for which the determination is to be made.

(7) Where the assessee is a person other than a company or a co-operative society, the deduction under sub-section (1) from profits and gains derived from an industrial undertaking shall not be admissible unless the accounts of the industrial undertaking for the previous year relevant to the assessment year for which the deduction is claimed have been audited by an accountant, as defined in the _Explanation_ below sub-section (2) of [section 288](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091599', ''\);), and the assessee furnishes, along with his return of income, the report of such audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant.

(8) Where any goods held for the purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft are transferred to any other business carried on by the assessee, or where any goods held for the purposes of any other business carried on by the assessee are transferred to the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft and, in either case, the consideration, if any, for such transfer as recorded in the accounts of the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft does not correspond to the market value of such goods as on the date of the transfer, then, for the purposes of the deduction under this section, the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the business of the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft shall be computed as if the transfer, in either case, had been made at the market value of such goods as on that date :

**Provided** that where, in the opinion of the Assessing Officer, the computation of the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the business of the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft in the manner hereinbefore specified presents exceptional difficulties, the Assessing Officer may compute such profits and gains on such reasonable basis as he may deem fit.

_Explanation_.—In this sub-section, "market value", in relation to any goods, means the price that such goods would ordinarily fetch on sale in the open market.

(9) Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the assessee carrying on the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft to which this section applies and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged that the business transacted between them produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft, the Assessing Officer shall, in computing the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft for the purposes of the deduction under this section, take the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom.

(10) The Central Government may, after making such inquiry as it may think fit, direct, by notification in the Official Gazette, that the exemption conferred by this section shall not apply to any class of industrial undertakings with effect from such date as it may specify in the notification.
