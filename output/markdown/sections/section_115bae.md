**Provided also** that where the assessee fails to satisfy the conditions contained in sub-section (2) in any previous year, the option shall become invalid in respect of the assessment year relevant to that previous year and subsequent assessment years and other provisions of the Act shall apply to the assessee as if the option had not been exercised for the assessment year relevant to that previous year and subsequent assessment years.

(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the following conditions shall apply, namely:—

---|---|---  
(_b_) |  |  the assessee is not engaged in any business other than the business of manufacture or production of any article or thing and research in relation to, or distribution of, such article or thing manufactured or produced by it.  
|  |  _Explanation._ — For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the business of manufacture or production of any article or thing shall include the business of generation of electricity, but not include a business of,—

(3) The loss and depreciation referred to in sub-clause (_ii_) of clause (_c_) of sub-section (2) shall be deemed to have been given full effect to and no further deduction for such loss shall be allowed for any subsequent year.

(4) Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the assessee to which this section applies and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged that the business transacted between them produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in such business, the Assessing Officer shall, in computing the profits and gains of such business for the purposes of this section, take the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom:

**Provided** that in case the aforesaid arrangement involves a specified domestic transaction referred to in [section 92BA](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090986', ''\);), the amount of profits from such transaction shall be determined having regard to arm's length price as defined in clause (_ii_) of [section 92F](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090995', ''\);):

**Provided further** that the amount, being profits in excess of the amount of the profits determined by the Assessing Officer, shall be deemed to be the income of the assessee.

(5) Nothing contained in this section shall apply unless the option is exercised by the person in the prescribed manner on or before the due date specified under sub-section (1) of [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);) for furnishing the first of the returns of income for any previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 2024, and such option once exercised shall apply to subsequent assessment years:

**Provided** that once the option has been exercised for any previous year shall not be allowed to be withdrawn for the same or any other previous year.]
