**Exemption of capital gains on transfer of assets in cases of shifting of industrial undertaking from urban area.**

**54G.** (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), where the capital gain arises from the transfer of a capital asset, being machinery or plant or building or land or any rights in building or land used for the purposes of the business of an industrial undertaking situate in an urban area, effected in the course of, or in consequence of, the shifting of such industrial undertaking (hereafter in this section referred to as the original asset) to any area (other than an urban area) and the assessee has within a period of one year before or three years after the date on which the transfer took place,—

(_a_) |  |  purchased new machinery or plant for the purposes of business of the industrial undertaking in the area to which the said undertaking is shifted ;  
---|---|---  
(_b_) |  |  acquired building or land or constructed building for the purposes of his business in the said area ;  
(_c_) |  |  shifted the original asset and transferred the establishment of such undertaking to such area; and  
(_d_) |  |  incurred expenses on such other purpose as may be specified in a scheme framed by the Central Government for the purposes of this section,  
  
then, instead of the capital gain being charged to income-tax as income of the previous year in which the transfer took place, it shall be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions of this section, that is to say,—

(_i_) |  |  if the amount of the capital gain is greater than the cost and expenses incurred in relation to all or any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (_a_) to (_d_) (such cost and expenses being hereafter in this section referred to as the new asset), the difference between the amount of the capital gain and the cost of the new asset shall be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) as the income of the previous year; and for the purpose of computing in respect of the new asset any capital gain arising from its transfer within a period of three years of its being purchased, acquired, constructed or transferred, as the case may be, the cost shall be _nil_ ; or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_) |  |  if the amount of the capital gain is equal to, or less than, the cost of the new asset, the capital gain shall not be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);); and for the purpose of computing in respect of the new asset any capital gain arising from its transfer within a period of three years of its being purchased, acquired, constructed or transferred, as the case may be, the cost shall be reduced by the amount of the capital gain.  
  
_Explanation._ —In this sub-section, "urban area" means any such area within the limits of a municipal corporation or municipality as the Central Government may, having regard to the population, concentration of industries, need for proper planning of the area and other relevant factors, by general or special order, declare to be an urban area for the purposes of this sub-section.

(2) The amount of capital gain which is not appropriated by the assessee towards the cost and expenses incurred in relation to all or any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (_a_) to (_d_) of sub-section (1) within one year before the date on which the transfer of the original asset took place, or which is not utilised by him for all or any of the purposes aforesaid before the date of furnishing the return of income under [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);), shall be deposited by him before furnishing such return [such deposit being made in any case not later than the due date applicable in the case of the assessee for furnishing the return of income under sub-section (1) of [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);)] in an account in any such bank or institution as may be specified in, and utilised in accordance with, any scheme which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, frame in this behalf and such return shall be accompanied by proof of such deposit ; and, for the purposes of sub-section (1), the amount, if any, already utilised by the assessee for all or any of the purposes aforesaid together with the amount, so deposited shall be deemed to be the cost of the new asset :

**Provided** that if the amount deposited under this sub-section is not utilised wholly or partly for all or any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (_a_) to (_d_) of sub-section (1) within the period specified in that sub-section, then,—

(_i_) |  |  the amount not so utilised shall be charged under [section 45](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090820', ''\);) as the income of the previous year in which the period of three years from the date of the transfer of the original asset expires; and  
---|---|---  
(_ii_) |  |  the assessee shall be entitled to withdraw such amount in accordance with the scheme aforesaid.
