**Exemption for employee's contributions.**

**7.** An employee participating in a recognised provident fund shall, in respect of his own contributions to his individual account in the fund in the previous year, be entitled to a deduction in the computation of his total income of an amount determined in accordance with [section 80C](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090896', ''\);).

**Exclusion from total income of accumulated balance.**

**8.** The accumulated balance due and becoming payable to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund shall be excluded from the computation of his total income—

(_i_)|  |  if he has rendered continuous service with his employer for a period of five years or more, or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  if, though he has not rendered such continuous service, the service has been terminated by reason of the employee's ill-health, or by the contraction or discontinuance of the employer's business or other cause beyond the control of the employee, or  
(_iii_)|  |  if, on the cessation of his employment, the employee obtains employment with any other employer, to the extent the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to him is transferred to his individual account in any recognised provident fund maintained by such other employer; or  
(_iv_)|  |  if the entire balance standing to the credit of the employee is transferred to his account under a pension scheme referred to in [section 80CCD](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090901', ''\);) and notified by the Central Government.  
  
_Explanation._ —Where the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund maintained by his employer includes any amount transferred from his individual account in any other recognised provident fund or funds maintained by his former employer or employers, then, in computing the period of continuous service for the purposes of clause (_i_) or clause (_ii_) the period or periods for which such employee rendered continuous service under his former employer or employers aforesaid shall be included.

**Tax on accumulated balance.**

**9.** (1) Where the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund is included in his total income owing to the provisions of rule 8 not being applicable, the Assessing Officer shall calculate the total of the various sums of tax which would have been payable by the employee in respect of his total income for each of the years concerned if the fund had not been a recognised provident fund, and the amount by which such total exceeds the total of all sums paid by or on behalf of such employee by way of tax for such years shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax for which he may be liable for the previous year in which the accumulated balance due to him becomes payable.

(2) Where the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund which is not included in his total income under the provisions of rule 8 becomes payable, an amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts of super-tax on annual accretions that would have been payable under section 58E of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922), for any assessment year up to and including the assessment year 1932-33, if the Indian Income-tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1933 (18 of 1933), had come into force on the 15th day of March, 1930, shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax payable by him for the previous year in which such balance becomes payable.

**Deduction at source of tax payable on accumulated balance.**

**10.** The trustees of a recognised provident fund, or any person authorised by the regulations of the fund to make payment of accumulated balances due to employees, shall, in cases where sub-rule (1) of rule 9 applies, at the time an accumulated balance due to an employee is paid, deduct therefrom the amount payable under that rule and all the provisions of Chapter XVII-B shall apply as if the accumulated balance were income chargeable under the head "Salaries".

**Treatment of balance in newly recognised provident fund.**

**11.** (1) Where recognition is accorded to a provident fund with existing balances, an account shall be made of the fund up to the day immediately preceding the day on which the recognition takes effect, showing the balance to the credit of each employee on such day, and containing such further particulars as the Board may prescribe.

(2) The account shall also show in respect of the balance to the credit of each employee the amount thereof which is to be transferred to that employee's account in the recognised provident fund, and such amount (hereinafter called his transferred balance) shall be shown as the balance to his credit in the recognised provident fund on the date on which the recognition of the fund takes effect, and sub-rule (4) of this rule and sub-rule (5) of rule 5 shall apply thereto.

(3) Any portion of the balance to the credit of an employee in the existing fund which is not transferred to the recognised fund shall be excluded from the accounts of the recognised fund and shall be liable to income-tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act, other than this Part.

(4) Subject to such rules as the Board may make in this behalf, the Assessing Officer shall make a calculation of the aggregate of all sums comprised in a transferred balance which would have been liable to income-tax if this Part had been in force from the date of the institution of the fund, without regard to any tax which may have been paid on any sum, and such aggregate (if any) shall be deemed to be income received by the employee in the previous year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect and shall be included in the employee's total income for that previous year, and, for the purposes of assessment, the remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarded, but no other exemption or relief, by way of refund or otherwise, shall be granted in respect of any sum comprised in such transferred balance :

**Provided** that, in cases of serious accounting difficulty, the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may, subject to the said rules, make a summary calculation of such aggregate.

(5) Nothing in this rule shall affect the rights of the persons administering an unrecognised provident fund or dealing with it, or with the balance to the credit of any individual employee before recognition is accorded, in any manner which may be lawful.

**Accounts of recognised provident funds.**

**12.** (1) The accounts of a recognised provident fund shall be maintained by the trustees of the fund and shall be in such form and for such periods, and shall contain such particulars, as the Board may prescribe.

(2) The accounts shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by income-tax authorities, and the trustees shall furnish to the Assessing Officer such abstracts thereof as the Board may prescribe.

**Appeals.**

**13.** (1) An employer objecting to an order of the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner refusing to recognise or an order withdrawing recognition from a provident fund may appeal, within sixty days of such order, to the Board.

(2) The appeal shall be in such form and shall be verified in such manner and shall be subject to the payment of such fee as the Board may prescribe.

**Treatment of fund transferred by employer to trustee.**

**14.** (1) Where an employer, who maintains a provident fund (whether recognised or not) for the benefit of his employees and has not transferred the fund or any portion of it, transfers such fund or portion to trustees in trust for the employees participating in the fund, the amount so transferred shall be deemed to be of the nature of capital expenditure.

(2) When an employee participating in such fund is paid the accumulated balance due to him therefrom, any portion of such balance as represents his share in the amount so transferred to the trustees (without addition of interest, and exclusive of the employee's contributions and interest thereon) shall, if the employer has made effective arrangements to secure that tax shall be deducted at source from the amount of such share when paid to the employee, be deemed to be an expenditure by the employer within the meaning of [section 37](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090786', ''\);), incurred in the previous year in which the accumulated balance due to the employee is paid.

**Provisions relating to rules.**

**15.** (1) In addition to any power conferred by this Part, the Board may make rules—

(_a_)|  |  prescribing the statements and other information to be submitted along with an application for recognition;  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  limiting the contributions to a recognised provident fund by employees of a company who are shareholders in the company;  
(_bb_)|  |  regulating the investment or deposit of the moneys of a recognised provident fund :  
|  | **Provided** that no rule made under this clause shall require the investment of more than fifty per cent of the moneys of such fund in Government securities as defined in section 2 of the Public Debt Act, 1944 (18 of 1944);  
(_c_)|  |  providing for the assessment by way of penalty of any consideration received by an employee for an assignment of, or creation of a charge upon, his beneficial interest in a recognised provident fund;  
(_d_)|  |  determining the extent to and the manner in which exemption from payment of tax may be granted in respect of contributions and interest credited to the individual accounts of employees in a provident fund from which recognition has been withdrawn; and  
(_e_)|  |  generally, to carry out the purposes of this Part and to secure such further control over the recognition of provident funds and the administration of recognised provident funds as it may deem requisite.  
  
(2) All rules made under this Part shall be subject to the provisions of [section 296](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091619', ''\);).
