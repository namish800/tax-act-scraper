(_a_)|  |  for the purposes of acquiring, before the expiry of a period of ten years next following the previous year in which the ship or aircraft was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed, a new ship or a new aircraft or new machinery or plant [other than machinery or plant of the nature referred to in clauses (_a_), (_b_) and (_d_) of the second proviso to sub-section (1) for the purposes of the business of the undertaking; and

**Provided** that such opportunity shall not be allowed by the Assessing Officer in a case where the difference in the total income as proposed to be computed by him and the total income as returned by the assessee arises out of the application of the proviso to sub-section (1) of [section 145](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091187', ''\);) or sub-section (2) of that section or the omission by the assessee to disclose his income fully and truly.

(_c_)|  |  if at any time before the expiry of the ten years aforesaid, the assessee utilises the amount credited to the reserve account under sub-section (4) for distribution by way of dividends or profits or for remittance outside India as profits or for the creation of any assets outside India or for any other purpose which is not a purpose of the business of the undertaking,  
  
and the provisions of sub-section (4A) of [section 155](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091206', ''\);) shall apply accordingly:
