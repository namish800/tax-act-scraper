---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  where the calculation is made by the Assessing Officer for the purpose of making an order under sub-section (3) of [section 210](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091339', ''\);), the total income of the latest previous year in respect of which the assessee has been assessed by way of regular assessment or the total income returned by the assessee in any return of income furnished by him for any subsequent previous year, whichever is higher, shall be taken and income-tax thereon shall be calculated at the rates in force in the financial year;  
(_c_)|  |  where the calculation is made by the Assessing Officer for the purpose of making an amended order under sub-section (4) of [section 210](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091339', ''\);), the total income declared in the return furnished by the assessee for the later previous year, or, as the case may be, the total income in respect of which the regular assessment, referred to in that sub-section has been made, shall be taken and income-tax thereon shall be calculated at the rates in force in the financial year;  
(_d_)|  |  the income-tax calculated under clause (_a_) or clause (_b_) or clause (_c_) shall, in each case, be reduced by the amount of income-tax which would be deductible or collectible at source during the said financial year under any provision of this Act from any income (as computed before allowing any deductions admissible under this Act) which has been taken into account in computing the current income or, as the case may be, the total income aforesaid; and the amount of income-tax as so reduced shall be the advance tax payable:  
  
**Provided** that for computing liability for advance tax, income-tax calculated under clause (_a_) or clause (_b_) or clause (_c_) shall not, in each case, be reduced by the aforesaid amount of income-tax which would be deductible or collectible at source during the said financial year under any provision of this Act from any income, if the person responsible for deducting tax has paid or credited such income without deduction of tax or it has been received or debited by the person responsible for collecting tax without collection of such tax.

(2) Where the Finance Act of the relevant year provides that, in the case of any class of assessees, net agricultural income (as defined in that Act) shall be taken into account for the purposes of computing advance tax, then, the net agricultural income to be taken into account in the case of any assessee falling in that class, shall be—

(_a_)|  |  in cases where the Assessing Officer makes an order under sub-section (3) or sub-section (4) of [section 210](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091339', ''\);),—  
---|---|---  
(_i_)|  |  if the total income of the latest previous year in respect of which the assessee has been assessed by way of regular assessment forms the basis of computation of advance tax payable by him, the net agricultural income which has been taken into account for the purposes of charging income-tax for the assessment year relevant to that previous year; or  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  if the total income declared by the assessee for the later previous year referred to in sub-section (4) of [section 210](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091339', ''\);) forms the basis of computation of advance tax, the net agricultural income as returned by the assessee in the return of income for the assessment year relevant to such later previous year;  
(_b_)|  |  in cases where the advance tax is paid by the assessee on the basis of his estimate of his current income under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of [section 210](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091339', ''\);), the net agricultural income, as estimated by him, of the period which would be the previous year for the immediately following assessment year.

(_a_)|  |  in a case where the total income of the latest previous year in respect of which the Hindu undivided family has been assessed by way of regular assessment forms the basis of computation of advance tax, if the total income of any member of the family for the assessment year relevant to such latest previous year exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to income-tax in his case;  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  in a case where the total income of the previous year in respect of which a return of income is furnished by the Hindu undivided family under [section 139](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091167', ''\);) or in response to a notice under sub-section (1) of [section 142](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091178', ''\);) forms the basis of computation of advance tax, if the total income of any member of the family for the assessment year relevant to such previous year exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to income-tax in his case.
