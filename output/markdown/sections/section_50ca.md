**Special provision for full value of consideration for transfer of share other than quoted share.**

**50CA.** Where the consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer by an assessee of a capital asset, being share of a company other than a quoted share, is less than the fair market value of such share determined in such manner as may be prescribed, the value so determined shall, for the purposes of [section 48](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000090825', ''\);), be deemed to be the full value of consideration received or accruing as a result of such transfer:

**Provided** that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any consideration received or accruing as a result of transfer by such class of persons and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.

_Explanation._ â€”For the purposes of this section, "quoted share" means the share quoted on any recognised stock exchange with regularity from time to time, where the quotation of such share is based on current transaction made in the ordinary course of business.
