_Explanation_.—For the purposes of this sub-section, a person shall be deemed to have made full and true disclosure of his income or of the particulars relating thereto in any case where the excess of income assessed over the income returned is of such a nature as not to attract the provisions of [section 270A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091499', ''\);) or clause (_c_) of sub-section (1) of [section 271](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091501', ''\);).

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),—

(_a_)|  |  [***]  
---|---|---  
(_b_)|  |  if in a case falling under [section 270A](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091499', ''\);) or clause (_c_) of sub-section (1) of [section 271](javascript:ShowMainContent\('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000091501', ''\);), the amount of income in respect of which the penalty is imposed or imposable for the relevant assessment year, or, where such disclosure relates to more than one assessment year, the aggregate amount of such income for those years, exceeds a sum of five hundred thousand rupees,  
  
no order reducing or waiving the penalty under sub-section (1) shall be made by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner except with the previous approval of the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Director General or Director General, as the case may be.

(3) Where an order has been made under sub-section (1) in favour of any person, whether such order relates to one or more assessment years, he shall not be entitled to any relief under this section in relation to any other assessment year at any time after the making of such order :

**Provided** that where an order has been made in favour of any person under sub-section (1) on or before the 24th day of July, 1991, such person shall be entitled to further relief only once in relation to other assessment year or years if he makes an application to the income-tax authority referred to in sub-section (4) at any time before the 1st day of April, 1992.

(4) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on him by any other provision of this Act, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may, on an application made in this behalf by an assessee, and after recording his reasons for so doing, reduce or waive the amount of any penalty payable by the assessee under this Act or stay or compound any proceeding for the recovery of any such amount, if he is satisfied that—

(_i_)|  |  to do otherwise would cause genuine hardship to the assessee, having regard to the circumstances of the case; and  
---|---|---  
(_ii_)|  |  the assessee has co-operated in any inquiry relating to the assessment or any proceeding for the recovery of any amount due from him:  
  
**Provided** that where the amount of any penalty payable under this Act or, where such application relates to more than one penalty, the aggregate amount of such penalties exceeds one hundred thousand rupees, no order reducing or waiving the amount or compounding any proceeding for its recovery under this sub-section shall be made by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner except with the previous approval of the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Director General or Director General, as the case may be.

(4A) The order under sub-section (4), either accepting or rejecting the application in full or in part, shall be passed within a period of twelve months from the end of the month in which the application under the said sub-section is received by the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner:

**Provided** that no order rejecting the application, either in full or in part, shall be passed unless the assessee has been given an opportunity of being heard:

**Provided further** that where any application is pending as on the 1st day of June, 2016, the order shall be passed on or before the 31st day of May, 2017.

(5) Every order made under this section shall be final and shall not be called into question by any court or any other authority.
