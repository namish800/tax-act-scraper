---|---|---

(_c_)|  |  where one or more than one calendar month out of calendar months determined in accordance with clause (_a_) is or are included in a previous year, the amount determined in accordance with clause (_b_) shall be multiplied by the number of calendar months so included and the amount so arrived at shall be taken to be the _pro rata_ amount of discount for that previous year.
