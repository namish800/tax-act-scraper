B = any income accrued or arisen to, or received by a specified fund as a result of transfer of securities (other than shares in a company resident in India);

C1 = ratio of the aggregate of daily 'assets under management' of the specified fund held by non-resident unit holders (not being the permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) to the aggregate of daily total 'assets under management' of the specified fund, from the date of acquisition of the capital asset referred to in clause (_viiab_) of section 47 to the date of transfer of such capital asset;

C2 = ratio of the aggregate of daily 'assets under management' of the specified fund held by non-resident unit holders (not being the permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) to the aggregate of daily total 'assets under management' of the specified fund, from the date of acquisition of the security (other than shares in a company resident in India) to the date of transfer of such security.

D = any income accrued or arisen to, or received by a specified fund from securities issued by a non-resident (not being a permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) and where such income otherwise does not accrue or arise in India;

E = any income accrued or arisen to, or received by a specified fund from a securitisation trust which is chargeable under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession";

F1 = ratio of the 'assets under management' in the specified fund held by non-resident unit holders (not being the permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) to the total 'asset under management' of the specified fund, as on the date of receipt of such income from securities issued by a non- resident (not being a permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) and where such income otherwise does not accrue or arise in India; and

F2 = ratio of the 'assets under management' in the specified fund held by non-resident unit holders (not being the permanent establishment of a non-resident in India) to the total 'asset under management' of the specified fund, as on the date of receipt of such income from a securitisation trust which is chargeable under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession".

(2) The specified fund shall furnish an annual statement of exempt income in Form No. 10-IG electronically under digital signature on or before the due date, which is duly verified in the manner indicated therein.
